why if i change property in my .logo class to with :100% it takes up all the header space but when i write max-width to 100% it stay the original normal size i am a little confuse please explain this css behaviour in detail why is that

The behavior you're observing in CSS is due to the difference between the `width` and `max-width` properties and how they control the size of elements. Here's a detailed explanation:

### 1. **`width: 100%`:**

- **`width` defines the actual width** of an element. When you set `width: 100%`, the element will take up 100% of the width of its **parent container**.
- This means if the parent container (such as the header) is wider than the content of the `.logo` class, the logo will stretch to fill the entire width of the parent.
- **Example behavior**:
  - If the parent container (like a header) is 1000px wide, setting `width: 100%` on `.logo` will make it expand to **1000px**, even if the actual image or content inside is smaller (say 200px).

### 2. **`max-width: 100%`:**

- **`max-width` defines the maximum width** an element can be, but it does not force the element to be exactly that width. The element will **not exceed** the specified value, but it will only expand as much as its content needs.
- When you set `max-width: 100%`, the element can grow **up to** 100% of its parent’s width but will not stretch beyond the natural size of its content.
- **Example behavior**:
  - If your `.logo` is an image that naturally has a width of 200px, setting `max-width: 100%` ensures that the image will not grow beyond 100% of its parent’s width, but it will stay at its natural size of 200px if the parent is larger.

### Why the Difference in Behavior?

- **With `width: 100%`**, you're telling the `.logo` element to stretch and take up all available space inside its parent container, no matter what the natural size of the content (like an image) inside is.
- **With `max-width: 100%`**, you're allowing the element to take up space **only if it needs to** but never exceeding the size of its container. However, if the content's size is naturally smaller (e.g., a 200px wide logo image), it will keep its smaller size unless the container becomes smaller than the content.

### Real-World Example:

Let’s assume the `.logo` class is applied to an image inside a header:

```html
<header>
  <div class="logo">
    <img src="logo.png" alt="Logo" />
  </div>
</header>
```

- **With `width: 100%`**:

  ```css
  .logo {
    width: 100%;
  }
  ```

  This will make the `.logo` (and the image inside) stretch to fill the entire width of the header, even if the actual logo image is much smaller than the header.

- **With `max-width: 100%`**:
  ```css
  .logo img {
    max-width: 100%;
  }
  ```
  This will ensure that the image inside the `.logo` div stays at its normal size unless the parent container (the header) becomes smaller than the image’s original width. It will shrink the image to fit the parent if necessary, but will never stretch it beyond its natural size.

### Summary:

- **`width: 100%`** forces the element to stretch to the full width of its parent.
- **`max-width: 100%`** allows the element to take up space only as needed, without exceeding the width of the parent container.

In the case of a logo image, you usually want to use `max-width: 100%` to ensure it stays at its natural size or smaller, rather than stretching unnaturally.
